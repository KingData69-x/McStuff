# About

This plugin was made becuase the creator KingData69-x got bored and thought about making a plugin, so he watched videos on how to get started. He learned the basic and now he knows a lot about java code. This plugin will be coming out with better versions(more commands and options) so be ready! p.s. I dont know why I was talking in third person.
